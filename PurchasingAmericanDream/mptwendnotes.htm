        Side, decided to move to suburban Park Terrace. Says his wife Geraldene: 
        'We didn't have a down payment. But Frank was determined. He took out 
        a $20 bill and anded it to the salesman and said, 'This is to show that 
        I mean business.' We started to save for the down payment on the budget 
        plan and finally got a G.I. mortgage.' The Derricks now have a brick, 
        three-bedroom ranch house with two TV sets, an air conditioner, piano, 
        a dog, two birds, a 1953 Chrysler, and a Zoysia grass lawn that is the 
        envy of their neighbors. 'You know, a lot of Negroes never think too much 
        about their houses and their lawns in the city,' says Mrs. Derrick. 'But 
        when they come out here they really put all of themselves into their homes. 
        It lifts them up.'&quot;</p>

    <td><hr> <a name="mortgage"></a> <strong>mortgage</strong> The family in this 
      simulation would most likely be approved for a conventional mortgage, but 
      might also be approved for a VA-guaranteed mortgage. 
      <p>The median family income of a white family receiving an FHA loan in 1956 
        was $6,173. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing </em>(Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220.Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $6,716 for 1960. The family in this simulation 
        makes close to this if the wife's income is included. For the purpose 
        of this simulation the wife's income is not included, making it unlikely 
        the family would get an FHA-insured loan.</p>
      <p>The median family income of white families with VA mortgages in 1956 
        was $5,870. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $6,386.56 for 1960. The VA considered counting 
        a wife's income if the veteran couldn't qualify on the basis of his income 
        alone, but only under certain circumstances, including the wife's &quot;age, 
        the nature and length of her employment, and the composition of the family 
        [meaning number of children].&quot; Emily Card, &quot;Women, Housing Access, 
        and Mortgage Credit,&quot; <em>Signs</em>, Vol. 5, No. 3, Supplement: 
        Women and the American City (Spring, 1980), S217-S218. This simulation 
        argues that the VA would not count the white wife's income because she 
        was young enough to have a third child, after which they might consider 
        to include her income. Lenders were often hesitant to make a VA-guaranteed 
        loan on expensive properties because the maximum guarantee of a VA loan 
        was $7,500. To avoid such risks, some large financial institutions would 
        not accept VA loans if the unguaranteed portion exceeded 50 per cent of 
        the appraised value of the property. Saul B. Klaman, <em>The Postwar Residential 
        Mortgage Market: A Study by the National Bureau of Economic Research </em>(Princeton: 
        Princeton University Press, 1961), 93-94. The unguaranteed portion of 
        a loan on a home in Markham would be only about 42 percent--a more acceptable 
        risk to lenders. Therefore, although this family's effective income is 
        less than the median, the possibility that they might find a lender to 
        approve them for a VA loan existed.</p>
      <p>The median family income of white families with conventional mortgages 
        in 1956 was $5,750. Davis McEntire, Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing (Berkeley: University of 
        California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $6,256 for 1960. The white family in this 
        simulation makes this amount if the wife's income is included, but it 
        is not. However, $4,400 is a reasonable income for a $13,000 house, and 
        the arbitrary nature of mortgage lending practices meant that the family 
        could have happened to find an institution willing to count all or some 
        of the wife's income. U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, <em>Mortgage Money: 
        Who Gets It? A Case Study in Mortgage Lending Discrimination in Hartford, 
        Connecticut </em>(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1974), 
        18-29. </p>
      <p>Although the low interest rates associated with VA and FHA loans benefited 
        borrowers, the higher interest rates on conventional mortgages benefited 
        lenders, making them more attractive to them. Saul B. Klaman explains, 
        &#8220;in the face of generally rising interest rates and yields, federally 
        underwritten mortgages with less flexible rates became unattractive to 
        investors with alternative uses of funds.&#8221; Federally underwritten 
        mortgages suffered a competitive interest rate disadvantage compared to 
        conventional mortgages. The FHA was legally able to increase the permitted 
        maximum interest rate on FHA loans to make them more competitive with 
        conventional loans (as it did for example in December of 1956 when it 
        increased the interest rate from 4 &frac12; to 5 per cent. However, the 
        VA had no authority to increase the interest rate on VA loans, which was 
        at 4 &frac12; percent as 1956 ended. Federally-underwritten mortgages, 
        although advantageous to borrowers, could be difficult to obtain depending 
        on the status of the market at any given time. See Saul B. Klaman, The 
        Postwar Residential Mortgage Market: A Study by the National Bureau of 
        Economic Research (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961), 63 and 
        73.</p>
      <p>The median family income of white families with no mortgage in 1956 was 
        $3,568. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing </em>(Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $3,881.98 for 1960.</p>

    <td> <hr> <a name="downpayment"></a> <strong>down payment </strong>The down 
      payment required by the FHA on a house appraised at $13,000 in 1958 was 
      $400. Table 16: Illustration of Minimum Down-Payment Requirements on New 
      1-and 2-Family Homes Bought with FHA-insured Loans, 1955-1958. Leo Grebler, 
      &quot;Housing Issues in Economic Stabilization Policy,&quot; <em>Occasional 
      Paper 72</em> (Washington, D.C.: National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc. 
      1960), 75. The effective income of the family in this situation (family 
      income minus wife's income) is $4,400--$400 amounts to less than 10 percent, 
      a reasonable proportion. The down payment for a conventional mortgage would 
      be higher than that expected by the FHA, but would still be more manageable 
      than the $2,600 to $4,000 required in Deerfield or the $1,400 required on 
      the average ($17,500) house in Park Forest. 
      <p>In 1956 Congress reduced the minimum down payment requirements on existing 
        homes bought with FHA loans to match those for new homes in order to stimulate 
        building by facilitating the sale of old houses by owners seeking new 
        ones, so presumably the down payment on an existing home would be the 
        same as a new home for the 1958 data in this table. Leo Grebler, &quot;Housing 
        Issues in Economic Stabilization Policy,&quot; <em>Occasional Paper 72</em> 
        (Washington, D.C.: National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc. 1960), 72.</p>
