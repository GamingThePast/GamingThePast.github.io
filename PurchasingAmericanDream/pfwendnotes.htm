      <a name="leastexpensive"></a> <strong>least expensive</strong> Philip Klutznick, 
      one of the developers of Park Forest, wanted to offer a variety of houses 
      in a range of prices in order to appeal to the largest market possible, 
      including the market that made too much money to qualify for public housing 
      but not enough money to afford the houses being produced in the private 
      market. Klutznick admitted to borrowing his design for the Eastgate subdivision 
      from Levitt's standard Cape Cod design for Levittowns. Like Levitt's houses, 
      the 750 square foot Cape Cods were originally built with two bedrooms on 
      the ground floor and an unfinished second floor, but owners typically remodeled 
      the second floor to make two additional rooms. Eastgate's 283 homes were 
      the lowest-priced homes ever offered in Park Forest. In 1953, they sold 
      for between $11,000 and $11,500--25 percent lower than anything else in 
      the village. While they sold quickly, they continued to be the cheapest 
      and least desirable houses in Park Forest. Gregory C. Randall, <em>America's 
      Original GI Town: Park Forest, Illinois</em> (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins 
      University Press, 2000), 174-176. For more information on Levittown houses,

      <p>In <em>The Organization Man</em>, William Whyte argued that the Eastgate 
        area &#8220;strain[s] Park Foresters&#8217; pretensions of classlessness&#8221; 
        because there were enough differences in the housing for everyone to know 
        that they were the &#8220;lower class&#8221; of housing. However, Park 
        Foresters did not like to call the people who lived there &#8220;working 
        class,&quot; so they called them &quot;people who work with their hands&quot; 
        or &quot;blue collar.&quot; Even though the homes were well-designed and 
        kept, everyone&#8212;including those who lived in them&#8212;knew that 
        they were not quite a part of Park Forest as the others were. William

    <td><hr> <p><a name="customize"></a> <strong>customize </strong>Critics of 
        postwar suburban developments pointed out the conformity of their outward 
        appearance. However, remodeling was one way consumers could bring individuality 
        to a mass produced home. In 1960, the <em>New York Times </em>published 
        an article titled &quot;Guide to Remodeling: It Can Provide the Shortest 
        Route to Ideal Quarters.&quot; The article suggested that &quot;for many 
        families today, a 'new' home is an old one that they have remodeled...Whatever 
        the remodeling project, families who undertake it seem to fall into two 
        categories: those who need more space than they can afford in a new home, 
        and those who are tired of the stereotyped floor plans prevalent in buildings 
        constructed today.&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, &quot;Guide to Remodeling: 
        It Can Provide the Shortest Route to Ideal Quarters,&quot; March 30, 1960, 
        SMA4.</p>
      <p>Levittown was the quintessential postwar suburban development. In <em>Expanding 
        the American Dream: Building and Rebuilding Levittown</em> (Albany: State 
        University of New York Press, 1993), Barbara M. Kelley argues that Levittowners 
        actively reshaped the interiors of their homes, initially through do-it-yourself 
        projects and later through the growing industry of professional remodeling. 
      </p>
      <p>Kelly chides critics for their static view of postwar housing and advocates 
        a dynamic view instead. Standardization was necessary to meet the enormous 
        demand for housing after World War II. However, once the basic structures 
        were built, owners modified and customized their living space to suit 
        their own personal needs. The original design of the houses reinforced 
        a value system that was desirable and acceptable to the target market 
        of the builders&#8212;lower middle class and upper working class families. 
        Kelley argues that these families were included but not coerced into the 
        middle class by well-intentioned builders.</p>
      <p>However, families often found that the idealized upper-middle class design 
        did not suit the reality of their lower-middle class lives. Tension existed 
        between lower-income residents who wanted to expand the kitchen and other 
        working areas and the developers, who sought to provide scaled-down versions 
        of a thoroughly middle class house where leisure areas such as living 
        rooms were larger. Producers designed the kitchen to accomodate the middle-class 
        value of a &#8220;nonworking&#8221; wife. However, the 1956 Women&#8217;s 
        Congress on Housing determined that the domestic workspace was too small. 
        Homeowners responded to this problem with the concept of the squared kitchen, 
        which provided women with more work space. Kelley argues that the status 
        of the home may have declined, but consumers exerted agency in their inclusion 
        into the middle class. They negotiated the extent to which they adapted 
        middle class values in the arrangement of their physical space.</p>
      <p>At first, remodeling projects were largely a do-it-yourself affair, but 
        a professionalized and standardized remodeling industry quickly sprang 
        up to meet the demand for customized housing. Families sought to make 
        the most of their living space as they went through the various stages 
        of the life cycle. The professional remodeling industry reclaimed some 
        of consumers' agency in that it only offered so many options as were profitable. 
        However, there were enough choices available that consumers could still 
        have something relatively individualized if they were unable or unwilling 
        to do an entire remodeling project by themselves. Like the remodeling 
        industry, developers were driven by the profit motive to respond to consumers&#8217; 
        wishes. Levitt altered floor plans as well as exterior details to provide 
        consumers with some choice, although exteriors were generally kept the 
        same to maintain an outward appearance of conformity and aesthetic cohesion.</p>
      <p>Kelly concludes that &#8220;although the deliverers had neglected to 
        consult the homeowners prior to construction, the homeowners, far from 
        being passive, were more than willing to answer their own needs&#8221; 
        (100). A realistic representation of the suburban experience must take 
        into account the dynamic changes that occur over time, rather than the 
        typically static image of the suburbs as they were in the immediate postwar 
        period. </p>

        the second floor was one of the most popular alterations made to Levittown 
        houses. I have inferred that it is likely that some Eastgate residents 
        would have finished the second floor of their homes by 1960.</p>

      <p>In 1954, Park Forest was named an All-American City by the National Municipal 
        League for its efforts to build Rich Township High School. The high school's 
        physical structure was a $1,600,000 &quot;learning laboratory.&quot; Its 
        curriculum was based on the &quot;life adjustment&quot; concept that stressed 
        vocational skills as well as academic subjects. Parents occasionally complained 
        about the curriculum, demanding that more traditional academic subjects 
        be offered. However, when asked what they wanted students to learn from 
        their high school experience, most parents replied that they wanted their 
        children to learn how to get along with other people.</p>
      <p>Some parents felt that teachers at the six elementary schools were too 
        &#8220;permissive&#8221; because they allowed children's curiosity to 
        determine some of what they learned. Parents also questioned the flexibility 
        of grading. Instead of assigning traditional letter grades and percentages, 
        teachers used a checklist of criteria to rate student performance. William

      <p>The median family income of a white family receiving an FHA loan in 1956 
        was $6,173. $6,173 in 1960 dollars is $6,716. The family in this simulation 
        makes close to this if the wife's income is included. For the purpose 
        of this simulation the wife's income is not included, making it less likely 
        that the family would get an FHA-insured loan. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence 
        and Race: Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and

      <p>The median family income of white families with VA mortgages in 1956 
        was $5,870. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $6,386.56 for 1960. The VA considered counting 
        a wife's income if the veteran could not qualify on the basis of his income 
        alone, but only under certain circumstances, including the wife's &quot;age, 
        the nature and length of her employment, and the composition of the family 
        [meaning number of children].&quot; Emily Card, &quot;Women, Housing Access, 
        and Mortgage Credit,&quot; <em>Signs</em>, Vol. 5, No. 3, Supplement: 
        Women and the American City (Spring, 1980), S217-S218. </p>
      <p>This simulation argues that the VA would not count the wife's income 
        because she was young enough to have a third child, after which they might 
        consider to include her income. Furthermore, lenders were often hesitant 
        to make a VA-guaranteed loan on expensive properties because the maximum 
        guarantee of a VA loan was $7,500. To avoid such risks, some large financial 
        institutions would not accept VA loans if the unguaranteed portion exceeded 
        50 per cent of the appraised value of the property. In the case of the 
        average home in Park Forest, the unguaranteed portion was about 57 percent. 
        The unguaranteed portion of a loan on a home in Eastgate would be only 
        about 42 percent--a more acceptable risk to lenders. Therefore, although 
        this family's effective income is less than the median, the possibility 
        that they might find a lender to approve them for a VA loan existed. Saul 
        B. Klaman, <em>The Postwar Residential Mortgage Market: A Study by the 
        National Bureau of Economic Research </em>(Princeton: Princeton University 
        Press, 1961), 93-94. </p>
      <p>Although the low interest rates associated with VA and FHA loans benefited 
        borrowers, the higher interest rates on conventional mortgages benefited 
        lenders, making them more attractive to them. Saul B. Klaman explains, 
        &#8220;in the face of generally rising interest rates and yields, federally 
        underwritten mortgages with less flexible rates became unattractive to 
        investors with alternative uses of funds.&#8221; Federally underwritten 
        mortgages suffered a competitive interest rate disadvantage compared to 
        conventional mortgages. The FHA was legally able to increase the permitted 
        maximum interest rate on FHA loans to make them more competitive with 
        conventional loans (as it did for example in December of 1956 when it 
        increased the interest rate from 4 &frac12; to 5 per cent. However, the 
        VA had no authority to increase the interest rate on VA loans, which was 
        at 4 &frac12; percent as 1956 ended. Federally-underwritten mortgages, 
        although advantageous to borrowers, could be difficult to obtain depending 
        on the status of the market at any given time. See <em>Saul B. Klaman, 
        The Postwar Residential Mortgage Market: A Study by the National Bureau 
        of Economic Research</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961), 
        63 and 73.</p>
      <p>The median family income of white families with conventional mortgages 
        in 1956 was $5,750. $5,750 in 1960 dollars is $6,256. The white family 
        in this simulation makes this amount if the wife's income is included, 
        but it is not. However, $4,400 is still a reasonable income for a $13,000 
        house, and the arbitrary nature of mortgage lending practices meant that 
        the family could have happened to find an institution willing to count 
        all or some of the wife's income. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: 
        Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and Housing </em>(Berkeley: 
        University of California Press, 1960), 220; NASA, <em>Consumer Price Index

      <p>The median family income of white families with no mortgage in 1956 was 
        $3,568. $3,568 in 1960 dollars is $3,881.98. This family makes more than 
        the median for no mortgage and slightly less than the median for a conventional 
        mortgage, but on a less expensive home such as one in Eastgate might be 
        approved for a loan. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and 
        Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley:

      <p>The down payment required by the FHA on a house appraised at $13,000 
        in 1958 was $400. In 1956 Congress reduced the minimum down payment requirements 
        on existing homes bought with FHA loans to match those for new homes in 
        order to stimulate building by facilitating the sale of old houses by 
        owners seeking new ones, so presumably the down payment on an existing 
        home would be the same as a new home for the 1958 data in this table. 
        The effective income of the family in this situation (family income minus 
        wife's income) is $4,400--$400 amounts to less than 10 percent, a reasonable 
        proportion. The down payment for a conventional mortgage would be higher 
        than that expected by the FHA, but would still be more manageable than 
        the $2,600 to $4,000 required in Deerfield or the $1,400 required on the 
        average ($17,500) house in Park Forest. Leo Grebler, &quot;Housing Issues

      <a name="prestigious"></a> <strong>prestigious</strong> Philip Klutznick, 
      one of the developers of Park Forest, wanted to offer a variety of houses 
      in a range of prices in order to appeal to the largest market possible, 
      including the market that made too much money to qualify for public housing 
      but not enough money to afford the houses being produced in the private 
      market. Klutznick admitted to borrowing his design for the Eastgate subdivision 
      from Levitt's standard Cape Cod design for Levittowns. Like Levitt's houses, 
      the 750 square foot Cape Cods were originally built with two bedrooms on 
      the ground floor and an unfinished second floor, but owners typically remodeled 
      the second floor to make two additional rooms. Eastgate's 283 homes were 
      the lowest-priced homes ever offered in Park Forest. In 1953, they sold 
      for between $11,000 and $11,500--25 percent lower than anything else in 
      the village. While they sold quickly, they continued to be the cheapest 
      and least desirable houses in Park Forest. Gregory C. Randall, <em>America's 
      Original GI Town: Park Forest, Illinois</em> (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins 
      University Press, 2000), 174-176. For more information on Levittown houses,

        area &#8220;strain[s] Park Foresters&#8217; pretensions of classlessness&#8221; 
        because there were enough differences in the housing for everyone to know 
        that they were the &#8220;lower class&#8221; of housing. However, Park 
        Foresters did not like to call the people who lived there &#8220;working 
        class,&quot; so they called them &quot;people who work with their hands&quot; 
        or &quot;blue collar.&quot; Even though the homes were well-designed and 
        kept, everyone&#8212;including those who lived in them&#8212;knew that
