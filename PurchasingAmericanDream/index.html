    <td width="50%"><p>A home in the suburbs is the hallmark of the American Dream. Homeownership
        became a reality for many people after World War II. The demand for housing
        increased rapidly as veterans returned from the war and started families.
        The federal government subsidized the private building industry's efforts
        to supply the enormous demand. </p>
      <p>In order to build many houses in a short period of time, builders applied
        the techniques of mass production to the construction of houses. The houses
        were small, identical to one another, and often poorly constructed, but
        most importantly they were affordable. They sold quickly and many Americans
        realized the dream of homeownership for the first time.</p>
      <p>By 1960, many of these families had improved their financial status and
        <a href="introendnotes.htm#tradedup">traded up</a> their first home for
        a bigger home in a better community. Families sought more <a href="introendnotes.htm#individualized">individualized</a>
        housing. Once again, builders responded to the demand.</p>
      <p> Only the wealthiest consumers could have a one-of-a-kind home, however.
        The average family had to choose among the options it could afford. In
        addition to income, race determined the choices that a family could make.
