        A less expensive home requires a lower down payment and lower monthly 
        payments. For example, the FHA-required down payment on a $13,000 house 
        in Park Terrace would be about $400 instead of the $2,600 to $4,000 required 
        for a house in Deerfield or the $1,400 required for the average house 
        in Park Forest. The FHA-required down payment on a home in the Eastgate 
        subdivision of Park Forest would also be about $400, but this simulation 
        argues that the family represented here would not be approved for a home 
        in Eastgate because of lenders' racial attitudes. Leo Grebler, &quot;Housing

    <td height="127"> <hr> <p><a name="installmentplan"></a> <strong>installment 
        plan</strong> Park Terrace had a layaway system that allowed buyers to 
        pay out the down payments as monthly installments. Frank Derrick, a postman 
        who made $4,000 a year according to <em>Time</em>, was able to purchase 
        a home by saving for the down payment on the installment plan and then 
        getting a VA-guaranteed mortgage. Although the family in this simulation 
        makes slightly less than Frank Derrick ($3,900 if the wife's income is 
        included, about $3,300 if it is not), I argue that it is plausible to 
        suggest that they could buy a home in Park Terrace when the racial character 
        of the suburb is also considered. <em>Time</em> observed that African 
        Americans often had to pay higher interest rates (1 to 2 percent) on mortgages 
        than whites did, but also that &quot;mortgage companies are beginning 
        to realize that steadily employed Negroes are a good risk.&quot; <em>Time</em>,

      <p>The caveat to this, of course, was that steadily employed African Americans 
        were a good risk if the loan was on a low-to-medium priced house in an 
        area that had either peacefully integrated or was in transition to all-African 
        American. Deerfield and Park Forest did not meet these criteria, but Markham

      <p>Falling property values were often the result of a self-fulfilling prophecy 
        as white homeowners, seeking to avoid perceived &quot;influxes&quot; of 
        African Americans, increased the supply (and decreased the price) of housing 
        in the area. Many lenders indicated that they would only lend to African 
        Americans within an established African American neighborhood, or one 
        that was in transition from white to African American. Davis McEntire, 
        <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission 
        on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960), 
        224-226. </p>
      <p>Concern for public relations also prevented lenders from making loans 
        in areas that were not transitioning from white to African American. A 
        banker from Cleveland was quoted in<em> The Cleveland Press</em> on September 
        8, 1956: &quot;We do not finance the first Negro purchaser in a white 
        area for public relations reasons. White resentment in the area would 
        be great, probably resulting in account cancellations and discontinuance 
        of other business. However, we do not insist that neighborhoods be 50 
        percent colored, or insist on any arbitrary statistical line before lending 
        to Negro applicants. Depends on circumstances.&quot; Davis McEntire, <em>Residence 
        and Race: Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and 
        Housing</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960), 225</p>
      <p>Park Terrace was an established African American neighborhood in Markham, 
        making it likely that lenders would be willing to lend on homes in the 
        area to reasonably qualified applicants.</p>

      <p>Lenders did not want to approve loans on slum properties with little 
        value. They preferred areas that were affordable for African Americans 
        but also of decent quality and well-maintained. Markham's Park Terrace 
        subdivision qualified as having both good-quality housing and being open 
        to minorities. The overall risk to lenders of loaning to the African American 
        family in this situation would be much less in Park Terrace than in Deerfield 
        or Park Forest, suggesting that this family had a reasonably good chance 
        of purchasing a home in Park Terrace.</p>

      <p>The median family income of nonwhite families with FHA loans in 1956 
        was $5,319. $5,319 in 1960 dollars is $5,787. Even with the inclusion 
        of the wife's income, the African American family in this simulation makes 
        almost $2,000 less than this amount, making it unlikely that they would 
        be able to secure an FHA loan. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: 
        Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and Housing </em>(Berkeley: 
        University of California Press, 1960), 220; NASA, <em>Consumer Price Index

      <p>Although the low interest rates associated with VA and FHA loans benefited 
        borrowers, the higher interest rates on conventional mortgages benefited 
        lenders, making them more attractive to them. Saul B. Klaman explains, 
        &#8220;in the face of generally rising interest rates and yields, federally 
        underwritten mortgages with less flexible rates became unattractive to 
        investors with alternative uses of funds.&#8221; Federally underwritten 
        mortgages suffered a competitive interest rate disadvantage compared to 
        conventional mortgages. The FHA was legally able to increase the permitted 
        maximum interest rate on FHA loans to make them more competitive with 
        conventional loans (as it did for example in December of 1956 when it 
        increased the interest rate from 4 &frac12; to 5 per cent. However, the 
        VA had no authority to increase the interest rate on VA loans, which was 
        at 4 &frac12; percent as 1956 ended. Federally-underwritten mortgages, 
        although advantageous to borrowers, could be difficult to obtain depending 
        on the status of the market at any given time. See Saul B. Klaman, <em>The 
        Postwar Residential Mortgage Market: A Study by the National Bureau of 
        Economic Research</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961), 
        63 and 73.</p>
      <p>The median family income of nonwhite families with conventional mortgages 
        in 1956 was $3,835. $3,835 in 1960 dollars is $4,172.48. If the wife's 
        income were included in this simulation, the family would make close to 
        the median ($3,900). The wife's income is not included; however, the lower 
        cost of houses in and the racial composition of Park Terrace suggest that 
        lenders would consider an income of $3,300 sufficient to qualify for a 
        mortgage. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220; NASA, <em>Consumer Price Index Inflation

      <p>The median family income of nonwhite families with no mortgages in 1956 
        was $2,238. $2,238 in 1960 dollars is $2,435. Families without mortgages 
        could usually only afford the least expensive housing available, which 
        was typically overcrowded and often in slum areas. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence 
        and Race: Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and 
        Housing </em>(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960), 220; NASA,

      <p>The African American family in this simulation has an income between 
        the median for a conventional mortgage and no mortgage. In an area where 
        many African Americans already lived and where relatively inexpensive 
        housing could be found--such as Markham's Park Terrace--it is feasible 
        to suggest that this family might be approved for a conventional mortgage 
        at a higher interest rate than a government-underwritten mortgage. <em>Time 
        </em>(&quot;A Lift in Living,&quot; September 21, 1959, 28) observed that 
        although &quot;Negro mortgage money is often a stiff 1% or 2% more than 
        for whites...mortgage companies are beginning to realize that steadily 
        employed Negroes are a good risk.&quot; The caveat to this, of course, 
        was that steadily employed African Americans were a good risk if the loan 
        was on a low-to-medium priced house in an area that had either peacefully 
        integrated or was in transition to all-African American. Deerfield and

      existing homes bought with FHA loans to match those for new homes in order 
      to stimulate building by facilitating the sale of old houses by owners seeking 
      new ones, so presumably the down payment on an existing home would be the 
      same as a new home for the 1958 data in this table. The down payment for 
      a conventional mortgage would be higher than that expected by the FHA, but

        population African American by 1960, Markham was not in the same situation 
        as Deerfield or Park Forest, where lenders were waiting to see if homeowners 
        would panic sell in response to an &quot;influx&quot; of African Americans. 
        If panic selling had occurred when African Americans first moved into 
        Markham, lenders could be assured by 1960 that property values had stabilized.

        Park Forest, lenders would have to be less concerned about public relations 
        in Markham. The 78.4% of whites who lived in Markham in 1960 were accustomed 
        to the fact that African Americans lived in their community. They were 
        very unlikely to challenge the entry of another African American into 
        the area. Dave Bartlett, &#8220;Markham, IL,&#8221; <em>The Electronic
