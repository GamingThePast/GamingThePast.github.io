        Davis McEntire explains clearly the issues minorities face when seeking 
        mortgages: &quot;Mortgage credit is the key to acquisition of good housing 
        via homeownership. But, of course, any person seeking a loan to buy a 
        house must possess adequate financial status to qualify for credit according 
        to prevailing standards, and he must be able to offer a suitable property 
        as security for the loan. In both respects, the minority groups are under 
        a disadvantage. Because of their relatively low incomes and instability 
        of income sources, fewer of the minorities than of the white majority 
        are able to meet the customary credit standards of mortgage-lending institutions. 
        With limited access to the housing supply, they are also less able to 
        obtain properties mortgageable on favorable terms, or any terms.&quot;

        to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University of California

        &#8220;Even with the contingent liability of the federal government, the 
        market does not regard FHA and VA loans as riskless assets. In judging 
        them as investments it applies traditional standards of quality, just 
        as in judging conventional mortgages. Thus, from the point of view of 
        the lender, government underwritten loans with all the advantages noted, 
        if secured by poorly located or otherwise less desirable properties, will 
        command lower prices or higher yields than loans on more favorable or

        Falling property values were often the result of a self-fulfilling prophecy 
        as white homeowners, seeking to avoid perceived &quot;influxes&quot; of 
        African Americans, increased the supply (and decreased the price) of housing 
        in the area. Many lenders indicated that they would only lend to Negroes 
        within an established Negro neighborhood, or one that was in transition 
        from white to Negro. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and

      <p>Despite experiencing discrimination in obtaining federally-underwritten 
        loans, African Americans benefited more from VA loans than from FHA loans. 
        &quot;Because of its more liberal underwriting policies, the VA program 
        reaches further down in the income hierarchy than the FHA, and for this 
        reason it has been of more direct help to members of minority groups. 
        Nearly 18 percent of all first mortgages on nonwhite, owner-occupied, 
        nonfarm properties in 1956 were guaranteed by VA as compared to 12 percent

        A. Auger, &#8220;Deerfield, IL,&#8221; <em>The Electronic Encyclopedia

        They would most likely have been upper-class families with very high incomes, 
        well above the median income for Negroes. Studies of integrated housing 
        (in particular, Davis McEntire's <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em>, Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960) generally suggest that white families are not 
        necessarily opposed to a few nonwhite families living in their community. 
        Only when certain conditions occur do whites tend to voice their opposition. 
        These conditions include a perceived (if not real) influx of nonwhites, 
        fear of declining property values as a community transitions from white 
        to nonwhite, being surrounded on more than one side by a predominantly 
        nonwhite community, or having a concentration of nonwhites within the 
        community forming a sort of &quot;suburban ghetto.&quot; It is possible 
        that the 20% of homes for sale to Negroes in the Floral Park subdivision 
        of Deerfield represented a potential &quot;suburban ghetto&quot; in the 
        minds of the whites living in the village, despite the high cost ($30,000-$40,000) 
        of the homes, and that this was one of the main reasons for their strong 
        opposition to the development. </p>
      <p>The fear of declining property values was often used as a justification 
        to sustain segregated housing, although that fear often became a self-fulfilling 
        prophecy as homeowners sold their houses en masse and glutted the market, 
        as Davis McEntire shows in <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 84. Although <em>Time</em> magazine suggested 
        that &quot;Deerfield's trouble is not so much hard-shell racism as pocket-book 
        fear,&quot; some of the quotations associated with the controvesy had 
        racist messages. <em>Time</em>, &quot;High Cost of Democracy,&quot; December

        individual interaction with members of other races reinforced the belief 
        that all African Americans were alike based only on their race and therefore 
        were all fundamentally different than whites, despite an emerging tendency

        A North Shore householder quoted in <em>Time</em>, &quot;High Cost of 
        Democracy,&quot; December 7, 1959, 23.</p>
      <p>By 1960, housing had become a major civil rights issue in the context 
        of the 1954 <em>Brown v. Board</em> decision and the 1955 Montgomery Bus 
        Boycott, as well as voting rights. The <em>Brown v. Board </em>decision 
        ruled that &quot;separate but equal&quot; school facilities for African 
        Americans and whites were inherently unequal. Segregated schools were 
        deemed unconstitutional. Likewise, the Montgomery Bus Boycott resulted 
        in a Supreme Court decision that ruled segregation on public transportation 
        unconstitutional. Remarks by Robert Weaver echoed the connection between 
        the various arenas of civil rights activity: &#8220;in housing, as in 
        most other areas, there is no such thing as separate but equal...The NAACP 
        cannot fight for racial integration in public schools and acquiesce to 
        segregated suburbs.&quot; Segregated housing was a particularly important 
        issue in light of <em>Brown v. Board</em> because it often resulted in 
        the de facto segregation of schools.</p>
      <p>The Housing Act of 1949 declared that the national housing objective 
        was &#8220;the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent 
        home and suitable living environment for every American family.&#8221; 
        By 1960, a growing African American middle class was increasingly able 
        to afford better housing, but they were unable to obtain this housing 
        because of restricted access to the general market. A select group of 
        builders and lenders were beginning to see the potential for profit in 
        catering to this growing middle class, but for the most part society remained 
        adverse to the inclusion of African Americans in the free market for housing. 
        Builders and lenders may have sensed that the reprisal from those opposed 
        to African Americans having equal access to housing would outweigh the 
        profit to be made from granting that access. The capitalist system, predicated 
        on a belief in the profit motive of a free market and couched in the language 
        of democracy, restricted the agency of these African Americans. While 
        civil rights leaders championed equal access to housing in addition to 
        schools, transportation, and voting, the attitudes of the African American 
        people are an area for further inquiry. McEntire notes that many African 
        Americans indicated in interviews that they did not want to be &quot;pioneers&quot; 
        into white areas. A study of the housing market from the perspective of 
        average African Americans--rather than lenders, government commissions, 
        or civil rights leaders--would help to illuminate the question of African 
        American consumer agency. Furthermore, like all social issues the issue 
        of discrimination housing was more complex than simply a matter of passing 
        a law or ruling it unconstitutional. Wyatt observes that &quot;even if 
        Negroes were free to compete in the open market for more adequate housing 
        on the same basis as whites, they would still be at a decided disadvantage 
        because of lower incomes.&#8221; A solution for equal access to housing 
        would have to address the issue of differences in pay within occupations 
        as well as the discrimination that restricted African Americans from obtaining 
        higher-paying jobs in professional occupations.</p>

        but it is not (see <strong>working</strong> below). Furthermore, a family 
        would probably have to make much more than the median to be approved for 
        a $23,000 house. </p>
      <p>The median family income of nonwhite families with FHA loans in 1956

        of California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $5,787 for 1960. Even with the inclusion 
        of the wife's income, the African American family in this simulation makes 
        almost $2,000 less than this amount. </p>
      The median family income of nonwhite families with no mortgages in 1956 
      was $2,238. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
      Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University

      Calculator gives a result of $2,435 for 1960.$2,435. Families without mortgages 
      could usually only afford the least expensive housing available, which was 
      typically overcrowded and often in slum areas. 
      <p>The African American family in this simulation has an income between 
        the median for a conventional mortgage and no mortgage. In an area where 
        many African Americans already lived and where relatively inexpensive 
        housing could be found, it is feasible to suggest that this family might 
        be approved for a conventional mortgage at a higher interest rate than 
        a government-underwritten mortgage. </p>
      <p>Although the low interest rates associated with VA and FHA loans benefited 
        borrowers, the higher interest rates on conventional mortgages benefited 
        lenders, making them more attractive to them. Saul B. Klaman explains, 
        &#8220;in the face of generally rising interest rates and yields, federally 
        underwritten mortgages with less flexible rates became unattractive to 
        investors with alternative uses of funds.&#8221; Federally underwritten 
        mortgages suffered a competitive interest rate disadvantage compared to 
        conventional mortgages. The FHA was legally able to increase the permitted 
        maximum interest rate on FHA loans to make them more competitive with 
        conventional loans (as it did for example in December of 1956 when it 
        increased the interest rate from 4 &frac12; to 5 per cent. However, the 
        VA had no authority to increase the interest rate on VA loans, which was 
        at 4 &frac12; percent as 1956 ended. Federally-underwritten mortgages, 
        although advantageous to borrowers, could be difficult to obtain depending 
        on the status of the market at any given time. See Saul B. Klaman, <em>The 
        Postwar Residential Mortgage Market: A Study by the National Bureau of 
        Economic Research</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961),

        Therefore, a $23,000 house in Deerfield would require a down payment of 
        about $2,600 to $4,000. Table 16: Illustration of Minimum Down-Payment

      <p>In 1956 Congress reduced the minimum down payment requirements on existing 
        homes bought with FHA loans to match those for new homes in order to stimulate 
        building by facilitating the sale of old houses by owners seeking new 
        ones, so presumably the down payment on an existing home would be the 
        same as a new home for the 1958 data in this table. Leo Grebler, &quot;Housing

        limited women in the mortgage market because their incomes were thought 
        to be unstable...the spectre of pregnancy dominated the lending world's 
        view...To lenders, all women under the age of fifty were candidates for 
        marriage and motherhood. It was considered self-evident that as soon as 
        a woman married, or shortly thereafter, she would drop out of the work 
        force and thereby render herself incapable of sustaining a mortgage payment.&quot;

      <p>The 1968 Fair Housing Act prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental, 
        and financing of housing on account of race, color, religion, and national 
        origin, but discrimination on the basis of sex was not prohibited. Not 
        until the passage of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in 1973 prohibited 
        discrimination on account of sex or marital status, and a 1974 companion 
        bill prohibited discrimination on account of sex under the Fair Housing 
        Act, were women's incomes regularly considered in lending decisions (before

        already had 2 or more children). Emily Card, &quot;Women, Housing Access,

      <p>A woman had a better chance of her income being counted if she was employed 
        in a professional occupation. The wife in this simulation is not. Policies 
        varied among and even within institutions. Some lenders would count some, 
        but not all, of a wife's income. Some lenders required a &quot;baby letter&quot; 
        attesting to the husband or wife's sterility, use of approved birth control 
        methods, or willingness to terminate a pregnancy in order to count the 
        wife's income. U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, <em>Mortgage Money: Who 
        Gets It? A Case Study in Mortgage Lending Discrimination in Hartford,

      <p>In 1960, the median income of female private household workers (white 
        and nonwhite) working full-time and year round (35 hours or more for 50 
        weeks or more) was $1,224. U.S. Bureau of the Census, <em>Statistical 
        Abstract of the United States: 1962</em>, Eighty-third edition (Washington, 
        D.C., 1962). Table No. 454: Money Income of Persons--Recipients and Median 
        Income, By Major Occupation Group and Sex: 1960, 336. The wife in this 
        simulation works only part-time, but the (approximately) $600 dollars 
        she contributes to the family income could make the difference between 
        qualifying for a home or not. However, even if the wife's income were 
        included in this case, $3,900 a year would still not be enough to buy 
        a $23,000 house.</p>
      <p>The figures for the median income of female private household workers 
        includes both white and nonwhite females; however, in <em>Residence and 
        Race: Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> 
        (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960), Davis McEntire suggests 
        that the gap between the incomes of white and nonwhite females is significantly 
        smaller than the gap between the incomes of white and nonwhite males, 
        perhaps because nonwhite women tend to complete more education and are 
        able to obtain better-paying jobs as a result, because nonwhite women 
        are perceived as less of a threat than nonwhite men, or because sex is 
        the primary form of discrimination faced by all women regardless of race.

        In its original context, this quotation was not made in reference to Deerfield. 
        However, the attitude of the quotation is typical of lending institutions 
        and reflects the fear of falling property values that ostensibly drove 
        the opposition to an integrated development in Deerfield. I have also 
        modified the quotation to fit the nature of the narrative. The original 
        is as follows: &quot;Said one executive, 'The infiltration of Negroes 
        into a white section knocks h--- out of values and does it quite fast....For 
        these reasons, this company does not wish to encourage, through lending, 
        the movement of Negroes into white neighborhoods.' Another stated: 'Our 
        company cannot make loans in these circumstances [Negroes entering white 
        areas]. Local correspondents would not accept such loans in the first 
        place because of the adverse effect on public relations. Besides, this 
        [life insurance] company has policy holders in practically every section 
        of every city in the country; if we were to finance the entry of a Negro 
        in a new neighborhood, we would hear from the policy holders.&quot; Davis 
        McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive Report to the 
        Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University of California 
        Press, 1960), 226-227.</p>
      <p>The development, however, was never built. The Deerfield Park Board had 
        on previous occasions been denied bond issues for public parks. They saw 
        the controversy over the development as an opportunity to obtain the land 
        for those parks. They told the developers to sell their land or condemnation 
        proceedings would begin. The developers didn't sell, and voters voted 
        2,635 to 1,207 in favor of a $550,000 bond issue to condemn the land for 
        parks. The builders sought an injunction to prevent the condemnation proceedings, 
        but a federal judge ruled that the park board could proceed with the condemnation. 
        The developers appealed. Despite a long series of court battles, the seizure 
        of the land for public parks was upheld. Wilma Dykeman and James Stokely,

        on the Color Line,&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, February 11, 1968. Although 
        the development was never built, even the prospect of an &quot;influx&quot; 
        of Negroes could affect lenders' attitudes. </p>

      <p>Many suburban communities like Deerfield experienced high rates of turnover 
        as heads of households were promoted and moved into housing commensurate 
        with their new salaries, or as families grew larger and remodeling was 
        not possible or desirable. Some communities were primarily filled with 
        starter homes, while others, such as Park Forest, diversified their offerings 
        to include both starter homes and higher-status housing. Typically, however, 
        a promotion meant moving out of one community and into another with higher-priced 
        homes and their concomitant higher status. Most young families climbing 
        the corporate ladder expected to be promoted or even transferred, and 
        so expectations for remaining in one place were often low. The awareness 
        that one was likely to move several times in ones life provides context 
        for some of the comments that refer to the fear of declining property 
        values as nonwhites moved into communities where whites expected to leave 
        their starter homes for something better. In 1959, a <em>New York Times</em> 
        article noted that 70 percent of home purchases were of existing rather 
        than new homes, commenting further that &#8220;the F.H.A. points out that 
        American families have made house-trading a tradition in the last generation. 
        Trading both up and down is becoming more frequent, as family needs change.&quot;
