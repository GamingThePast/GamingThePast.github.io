        They would most likely have been upper-class families with very high incomes, 
        well above the median income for Negroes. Studies of integrated housing 
        (in particular, Davis McEntire's <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em>, Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960) generally suggest that white families are not 
        necessarily opposed to a few nonwhite families living in their community. 
        Only when certain conditions occur do whites tend to voice their opposition. 
        These conditions include a perceived (if not real) influx of nonwhites, 
        fear of declining property values as a community transitions from white 
        to nonwhite, being surrounded on more than one side by a predominantly 
        nonwhite community, or having a concentration of nonwhites within the 
        community forming a sort of &quot;suburban ghetto.&quot; It is possible 
        that the 20% of homes for sale to Negroes in the Floral Park subdivision 
        of Deerfield represented a potential &quot;suburban ghetto&quot; in the 
        minds of the whites living in the village, despite the high cost ($30,000-$40,000) 
        of the homes, and that this was one of the main reasons for their strong 
        opposition to the development. </p>
      <p>The fear of declining property values was often used as a justification 
        to sustain segregated housing, although that fear often became a self-fulfilling 
        prophecy as homeowners sold their houses en masse and glutted the market, 
        as Davis McEntire shows in <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 84. Although <em>Time</em> magazine suggested 
        that &quot;Deerfield's trouble is not so much hard-shell racism as pocket-book 
        fear,&quot; some of the quotations associated with the controvesy had 
        racist messages. <em>Time</em>, &quot;High Cost of Democracy,&quot; December

        A North Shore householder quoted in <em>Time</em>, &quot;High Cost of 
        Democracy,&quot; December 7, 1959, 23. </p>
      <p>By 1960, housing had become a major civil rights issue in the context 
        of the 1954 <em>Brown v. Board</em> decision and the 1955 Montgomery Bus 
        Boycott, as well as voting rights. The <em>Brown v. Board </em>decision 
        ruled that &quot;separate but equal&quot; school facilities for African 
        Americans and whites were inherently unequal. Segregated schools were 
        deemed unconstitutional. Likewise, the Montgomery Bus Boycott resulted 
        in a Supreme Court decision that ruled segregation on public transportation 
        unconstitutional. Remarks by Robert Weaver echoed the connection between 
        the various arenas of civil rights activity: &#8220;in housing, as in 
        most other areas, there is no such thing as separate but equal...The NAACP 
        cannot fight for racial integration in public schools and acquiesce to 
        segregated suburbs.&quot; Segregated housing was a particularly important 
        issue in light of <em>Brown v. Board</em> because it often resulted in 
        the de facto segregation of schools.</p>
      <p>The Housing Act of 1949 declared that the national housing objective 
        was &#8220;the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent 
        home and suitable living environment for every American family.&#8221; 
        By 1960, a growing African American middle class was increasingly able 
        to afford better housing, but they were unable to obtain this housing 
        because of restricted access to the general market. A select group of 
        builders and lenders were beginning to see the potential for profit in 
        catering to this growing middle class, but for the most part society remained 
        adverse to the inclusion of African Americans in the free market for housing. 
        Builders and lenders may have sensed that the reprisal from those opposed 
        to African Americans having equal access to housing would outweigh the 
        profit to be made from granting that access. The capitalist system, predicated 
        on a belief in the profit motive of a free market and couched in the language 
        of democracy, restricted the agency of these African Americans. While 
        civil rights leaders championed equal access to housing in addition to 
        schools, transportation, and voting, the attitudes of the African American 
        people are an area for further inquiry. McEntire notes that many African 
        Americans indicated in interviews that they did not want to be &quot;pioneers&quot; 
        into white areas. A study of the housing market from the perspective of 
        average African Americans--rather than lenders, government commissions, 
        or civil rights leaders--would help to illuminate the question of African 
        American consumer agency. Furthermore, like all social issues the issue 
        of discrimination housing was more complex than simply a matter of passing 
        a law or ruling it unconstitutional. Wyatt observes that &quot;even if 
        Negroes were free to compete in the open market for more adequate housing 
        on the same basis as whites, they would still be at a decided disadvantage 
        because of lower incomes.&#8221; A solution for equal access to housing 
        would have to address the issue of differences in pay within occupations 
        as well as the discrimination that restricted African Americans from obtaining 
        higher-paying jobs in professional occupations.</p>

      University of California Press, 1960) generally suggest that white families 
      are not necessarily opposed to a few nonwhite families living in their community. 
      Only when certain conditions occur do whites tend to voice their opposition. 
      These conditions include a perceived (if not real) influx of nonwhites, 
      fear of declining property values as a community transitions from white 
      to nonwhite, being surrounded on more than one side by a predominantly nonwhite 
      community, or having a concentration of nonwhites within the community forming 
      a sort of &quot;suburban ghetto.&quot; It is possible that the 20% of homes 
      for sale to Negroes in the Floral Park subdivision of Deerfield represented 
      a potential &quot;suburban ghetto&quot; in the minds of the whites living 
      in the village, despite the high cost ($30,000-$40,000) of the homes, and

      of California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
      Calculator gives a result of $6,256 for 1960. The white family in this simulation 
      makes this amount if the wife's income is included, but it is not (see <strong>working</strong> 
      below). Furthermore, a family would probably have to make more than the 
      median to be approved for a $23,000 house. 
      <p>The median family income of a white family receiving an FHA loan in 1956 
        was $6,173. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive

        is included, the white family makes close to this amount, but the wife's 
        income is not included.</p>
      <p>The median family income of white families with VA mortgages in 1956 
        was $5,870. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $6,386.56 for 1960. The VA considered counting 
        a wife's income if the veteran couldn't qualify on the basis of his income 
        alone, but only under certain circumstances, including the wife's &quot;age, 
        the nature and length of her employment, and the composition of the family 
        [meaning number of children].&quot; Emily Card, &quot;Women, Housing Access, 
        and Mortgage Credit,&quot; <em>Signs</em>, Vol. 5, No. 3, Supplement: 
        Women and the American City (Spring, 1980), S217-S218. This simulation 
        argues that the VA would not count the white wife's income because she 
        was young enough to have a third child, after which they might consider 
        to include her income. Even if the VA decided to include the wife's income, 
        lenders had to approve the family first according to conventional standards. 
        Lenders were often hesitant to make a VA-guaranteed loan on expensive 
        properties because the maximum guarantee of a VA loan was $7,500. To avoid 
        such risks, some large financial institutions would not accept VA loans 
        if the unguaranteed portion exceeded 50 per cent of the appraised value 
        of the property. Saul B. Klaman, <em>The Postwar Residential Mortgage 
        Market: A Study by the National Bureau of Economic Research</em> (Princeton: 
        Princeton University Press, 1961), 93-94. In the case of a typical home 
        in Deerfield, the unguaranteed portion was about 67 per cent.</p>
      <p>Although the low interest rates associated with VA and FHA loans benefited 
        borrowers, the higher interest rates on conventional mortgages benefited 
        lenders, making them more attractive to them. Saul B. Klaman explains, 
        &#8220;in the face of generally rising interest rates and yields, federally 
        underwritten mortgages with less flexible rates became unattractive to 
        investors with alternative uses of funds.&#8221; Federally underwritten 
        mortgages suffered a competitive interest rate disadvantage compared to 
        conventional mortgages. The FHA was legally able to increase the permitted 
        maximum interest rate on FHA loans to make them more competitive with 
        conventional loans (as it did for example in December of 1956 when it 
        increased the interest rate from 4 &frac12; to 5 per cent. However, the 
        VA had no authority to increase the interest rate on VA loans, which was 
        at 4 &frac12; percent as 1956 ended. Federally-underwritten mortgages, 
        although advantageous to borrowers, could be difficult to obtain depending 
        on the status of the market at any given time. See Saul B. Klaman, <em>The 
        Postwar Residential Mortgage Market: A Study by the National Bureau of 
        Economic Research</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961), 
        63 and 73.</p>

      <p>The white family in this simulation has an effective income ($4,400 when 
        the wife's income is discounted) between the median for a conventional 
        mortgage and no mortgage. The family might not be able to afford a house 
        as expensive as one in Deerfield, but it would have a good chance of being 
        approved for a house with a lower income to value ratio.</p>

        Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and Housing (Berkeley:

        gap between the incomes of white and nonwhite females is significantly 
        smaller than the gap between the incomes of white and nonwhite males, 
        perhaps because nonwhite women tend to complete more education and are 
        able to obtain better-paying jobs as a result, because nonwhite women 
        are perceived as less of a threat than nonwhite men, or because sex is 
        the primary form of discrimination faced by all women regardless of race.

      median family income of white families with conventional mortgages in 1956 
      was $5,750. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
      Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
      of California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
      Calculator gives a result of $6,256 for 1960. The white family in this simulation 
      makes this amount if the wife's income is included, but it is not (see <strong>working</strong> 
      below). Furthermore, a family would probably have to make more than the 
      median to be approved for a $23,000 house. 
      <p>The median family income of a white family receiving an FHA loan in 1956 
        was $6,173. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220.Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $6,716 for 1960. Again, if the wife's income 
        is included, the white family makes close to this amount, but the wife's 
        income is not included.</p>
      <p>The median family income of white families with VA mortgages in 1956 
        was $5,870. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $6,386.56 for 1960. The VA considered counting 
        a wife's income if the veteran couldn't qualify on the basis of his income 
        alone, but only under certain circumstances, including the wife's &quot;age, 
        the nature and length of her employment, and the composition of the family 
        [meaning number of children].&quot; Emily Card, &quot;Women, Housing Access, 
        and Mortgage Credit,&quot; <em>Signs</em>, Vol. 5, No. 3, Supplement: 
        Women and the American City (Spring, 1980), S217-S218. This simulation 
        argues that the VA would not count the white wife's income because she 
        was young enough to have a third child, after which they might consider 
        to include her income. Even if the VA decided to include the wife's income, 
        lenders had to approve the family first according to conventional standards. 
        Lenders were often hesitant to make a VA-guaranteed loan on expensive 
        properties because the maximum guarantee of a VA loan was $7,500. To avoid 
        such risks, some large financial institutions would not accept VA loans 
        if the unguaranteed portion exceeded 50 per cent of the appraised value 
        of the property. Saul B. Klaman, <em>The Postwar Residential Mortgage 
        Market: A Study by the National Bureau of Economic Research</em> (Princeton: 
        Princeton University Press, 1961), 93-94. In the case of a typical home 
        in Deerfield, the unguaranteed portion was about 67 per cent.</p>
      <p>Although the low interest rates associated with VA and FHA loans benefited 
        borrowers, the higher interest rates on conventional mortgages benefited 
        lenders, making them more attractive to them. Saul B. Klaman explains, 
        &#8220;in the face of generally rising interest rates and yields, federally 
        underwritten mortgages with less flexible rates became unattractive to 
        investors with alternative uses of funds.&#8221; Federally underwritten 
        mortgages suffered a competitive interest rate disadvantage compared to 
        conventional mortgages. The FHA was legally able to increase the permitted 
        maximum interest rate on FHA loans to make them more competitive with 
        conventional loans (as it did for example in December of 1956 when it 
        increased the interest rate from 4 &frac12; to 5 per cent. However, the 
        VA had no authority to increase the interest rate on VA loans, which was 
        at 4 &frac12; percent as 1956 ended. Federally-underwritten mortgages, 
        although advantageous to borrowers, could be difficult to obtain depending 
        on the status of the market at any given time. See Saul B. Klaman, <em>The 
        Postwar Residential Mortgage Market: A Study by the National Bureau of 
        Economic Research</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961), 
        63 and 73.</p>
      <p>The median family income of white families with no mortgage in 1956 was 
        $3,568. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220. Using the NASA Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator gives a result of $3,881.98 for 1960. </p>
      <p>The white family in this simulation has an effective income ($4,400 when 
        the wife's income is discounted) between the median for a conventional 
        mortgage and no mortgage. The family might not be able to afford a house 
        as expensive as one in Deerfield, but it would have a good chance of being 
        approved for a house with a lower income to value ratio.</p>

      </strong>The down payment required by the FHA on a house appraised at $22,000 
      in 1958 was $2,600. For a house appraised at $24,000, the down payment was 
      $4,000. Therefore, a $23,000 house in Deerfield would require a down payment 
      of about $2,600 to $4,000. Table 16: Illustration of Minimum Down-Payment 
      Requirements on New 1-and 2-Family Homes Bought with FHA-insured Loans, 
      1955-1958. Leo Grebler, &quot;Housing Issues in Economic Stabilization Policy,&quot; 
      <em>Occasional Paper 72</em> (Washington, D.C.: National Bureau of Economic 
      Research, Inc. 1960), 75. 
      <p>This down payment amounts to 40 to 65 percent of a year's income for 
        the white family in this simulation. The down payment for a conventional 
        mortgage would likely be even higher than that expected by the FHA. </p>
      <p>In 1956 Congress reduced the minimum down payment requirements on existing 
        homes bought with FHA loans to match those for new homes in order to stimulate 
        building by facilitating the sale of old houses by owners seeking new 
        ones, so presumably the down payment on an existing home would be the 
        same as a new home for the 1958 data in this table. Leo Grebler, &quot;Housing 
        Issues in Economic Stabilization Policy,&quot; <em>Occasional Paper 72</em>

      Card explains: &quot;Sound business practice excluded or severely limited 
      women in the mortgage market because their incomes were thought to be unstable...the 
      spectre of pregnancy dominated the lending world's view...To lenders, all 
      women under the age of fifty were candidates for marriage and motherhood. 
      It was considered self-evident that as soon as a woman married, or shortly 
      thereafter, she would drop out of the work force and thereby render herself 
      incapable of sustaining a mortgage payment.&quot; <p>The 1968 Fair Housing 
        Act prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing 
        on account of race, color, religion, and national origin, but discrimination 
        on the basis of sex was not prohibited. Not until the passage of the Equal 
        Credit Opportunity Act in 1973 prohibited discrimination on account of 
        sex or marital status, and a 1974 companion bill prohibited discrimination 
        on account of sex under the Fair Housing Act, were women's incomes regularly 
        considered in lending decisions (before the laws were passed, women's 
        incomes were considered in limited cases where her husband could not qualify 
        on the basis of his income alone and where the woman was in the later 
        part of her childbearing years or had already had 2 or more children).

      <p>In 1960, the median income of female clerical and kindred workers working 
        full-time and year round (35 hours or more for 50 weeks or more) was $3,645.

        Money Income of Persons--Recipients and Median Income, By Major Occupation 
        Group and Sex: 1960, 336. The wife in this simulation works only part-time, 
        but the (approximately) $1,800 dollars she contributes to the family income 
        could make the difference between qualifying for a home or not. However, 
        even if the wife's income were included in this case, it would still be 
        difficult to buy a $23,000 house. The average salary of Deerfield residents 
        ($9,000) suggests that lenders expected qualifying families to make about 
        that much. </p>
