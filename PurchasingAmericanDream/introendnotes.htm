      <p><a name="tradedup" id="tradedup"></a> <strong>traded up</strong> A study 
        made by the Federal Housing Administration showed that almost 70 percent 
        of the homes purchased in the nation each year were existing houses rather 
        than new ones. &quot;The F.H.A. points out that American families have 
        made house-trading a tradition in the last generation. Trading both up 
        and down is becoming more frequent as family needs change.&quot; <em>New 
        York Times</em>, &quot;New Home Sales are in Minority: F.H.A. Finds That 
        Existing Houses Account for Bulk of Realty Transactions,&quot; February 
        8, 1959, R7.</p>
      <p>Lizabeth Cohen describes her childhood experience of trading up houses. 
        &quot;I moved into my first home in Paramus, New Jersey, a brand-new ranch-style 
        house...My parents had recently bought this 960-square-foot house for 
        $11,990...Four years later, my sister now in tow, we moved three miles 
        away to a larger, more expensive house in a more established, solidly 
        middle-class town...Four years later, when I was eight, we were on the 
        move again, this time to an upper-middle-class suburb in New York's Westchester 
        County.&quot; Lizabeth Cohen, <em>A Consumers' Republic: The Politics 
        of Mass Consumption in Postwar America</em> (New York: Vintage Books, 
        2003), 5-6.</p>
      <p>&quot;Trading up&quot; implies status as well as size (although the two 
        are usually directly related.) Families do &quot;trade down&quot; in size 
        and status as their needs or financial situation change. However, the 
        concept of the American <em>Dream</em> implies a continuous process of 
        trading up until the dream is achieved. This simulation assumes that the 
        families it represents are in a position to trade up rather than down.</p>

      <p><a name="individualized"></a> <strong>individualized</strong> Critics 
        of postwar suburbs focused on those built immediately after the war. It 
        is difficult to deny that postwar suburbs encouraged conformity in appearance 
        and behavior. Whether or not this conformity was a harmless effect of 
        necessarily using mass production to meet the demand for housing or a 
        more ominous example of Cold War-related fears is debatable. However, 
        by 1960 the issue of conformity was being discussed in the media in terms 
        of how consumers were eschewing this conformity in favor of variety. The 
        discourse focused on a &quot;post-post-war period&quot; driven less by 
        consumers' needs and more by their wants. Walter H. Stern, &quot;Realty 
        Men Look to New Era in '60,&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, January 10, 
        1960, R1.</p>
      <p>Consumers' choices were still limited by what was profitable for builders 
        to produce, but builders accommodated the most popular features and styles. 
        In &quot;Conformity in Houses: The Experienced House-Hunter Sees Much 
        Variety in Apparent Sameness,&quot; Walter Stern writes that &quot;there 
        is a remarkable amount of variety&quot; in the housing market. Buyers 
        benefited from the competition between builders to improve upon each other's 
        designs at acceptable costs. Housing styles such as the split-level were 
        &quot;primarily the developers' answer to a popular demand.&quot; Walter 
        H. Stern, &quot;Conformity in Houses: The Experienced House-Hunter Sees 
        Much Variety in Apparent Sameness,&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, December 
        4, 1960, R1. </p>
      <p>Another New York Times article reported that &quot;L.I. Developers Give 
        Purchasers Data on Prospective Neighbor.&quot; The builders of The Gates 
        at Woodbury, Morris Sosnow and Herbert Sadkin, responded to &quot;one 
        of the major concerns of prospective home buyers--the uncertainty about 
        what neighboring families will be like,&quot; by noting information such 
        as the age of children and type and color of home on the plot plan for 
        the development. Their experience &quot;with the considerations that sway 
        families in the choice of a home&quot; encouraged them to implement the 
        practice. The profit motive drove builders to institute the practice, 
        but consumers benefited as well in terms of being able to make a better 
        informed choice about the location and type of their home. &quot;For example, 
        someone planning to buy the two-story Colonial home at The Gates may find 
        that his preferred site adjoins another where an identical dwelling has 
        already been planned. Knowing this, he could select another location in 
        the colony or, if his needs are flexible, he could switch to the ranch 
        or split-level style, thus <em>retaining the individuality of his home</em> 
        (italics added).&quot; The article goes on to explain that the market 
        had changed since the immediate post-war period when developers offered 
        only one type of house and buyers had no choice of plot location. By 1960, 
        &quot;for one thing, developers in almost all price brackets offer a variety 
        of building styles. For another, buyers may choose almost any site within 
        the section currently under development.&quot; Furthermore, mass production 
        was &quot;giving way to more individual construction techniques.&quot; 
        Many families moving into The Gates were trading up. &quot;Many of the 
        purchasers already own homes, some of them in typical post-war developments 
        consisting of rows of identical dwellings. When buying their second and 
        more expensive home these families almost always insist on a measure of 
        individuality.&quot; However, individuality came at a higher price. &quot;In 
        colonies such as The Gates, where houses are priced from $33,700 to $38,000, 
        individuality is an especially important consideration.&quot; New York 
        Times, &quot;L.I. Developers Give Purchasers Data on Prospective Neighbor,&quot; 
        February 15, 1959, R1.</p>
      <p>Remodeling was also one way consumers could bring individuality to a 
        mass produced home. In 1960, the <em>New York Times </em>published an 
        article titled &quot;Guide to Remodeling: It Can Provide the Shortest 
        Route to Ideal Quarters.&quot; The article suggested that &quot;for many 
        families today, a 'new' home is an old one that they have remodeled...Whatever 
        the remodeling project, families who undertake it seem to fall into two 
        categories: those who need more space than they can afford in a new home, 
        and those who are tired of the stereotyped floor plans prevalent in buildings 
        constructed today.&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, &quot;Guide to Remodeling: 
        It Can Provide the Shortest Route to Ideal Quarters,&quot; March 30, 1960, 
        SMA4.</p>
      <p>Builders paid attention to the changes and improvements owners made to 
        their homes. Around 1958, Joseph Shapiro and Martin Buxbaum visited a 
        development they had built in order to observe the alterations owners 
        had made to the original ranch homes, which &quot;retained considerable 
        appeal over the years.&quot; Although the basic design of the house was 
        successful in its own right, the improvements kept the houses up-to-date 
        with the changing needs of families. Some of the improvements made to 
        the houses included the addition of informal living areas by enclosing 
        the patio, creating a new patio that extended into the back yard, enlarging 
        the kitchen, dining room, and garage spaces, eliminating closets in favor 
        of larger foyers, and extending the roof over the house's rear entrance. 
        <em>New York Times</em>, &quot;Housing Revised By L.I. Builders: New Designs 
        to Incorporate Changes Suggested by Owners for 5 Years,&quot; January 
        26, 1958, R1.</p>
      <p>Even the quintessential postwar community, Levittown, was not a static 
        entity in terms of conformity. In <em>Expanding the American Dream: Building 
        and Rebuilding Levittown</em> (Albany: State University of New York Press, 
        1993), Barbara M. Kelley argues that Levittowners actively reshaped the 
        interiors of their homes, initially through do-it-yourself projects and 
        later through the growing industry of professional remodeling. </p>

      <p><a name="compromise"></a> <strong>compromise</strong> &#8220;Probably 
        not many families achieve their dream house completely. Minority families 
        have less chance of doing so than others, and they must make more compromises 
        because the search must be conducted in a limited part of the housing 
        market.&quot; Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing </em>(Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 99. </p>
      <p>African Americans had to make more compromises than whites for two main 
        reasons. First of all, they typically had lower incomes than whites as 
        a result of differences in pay within occupations as well as discrimination 
        in obtaining better paying jobs. The large discrepancy between the median 
        income of whites and nonwhites can be explained not only by differential 
        earnings within occupations but perhaps even more so by the concentration 
        of nonwhites into lower paying occupations Daniel O. Price, <em>Changing 
        Characteristics of the Negro Population: A 1960 Census Monograph</em> 
        (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969), 111.</p>
      <p>Secondly, they faced discrimination from brokers, who would often refuse 
        to show African Americans certain areas, and lenders, who viewed African 
        Americans as a greater risk. &#8220;One of the strongest, most pervasive 
        barriers to the equal participation of minority groups in the housing 
        market is the withholding of real estate broker services, except under 
        special conditions. With occasional exceptions, real estate brokers offer 
        their services to minority homeseekers only in certain areas, usually 
        districts where minority persons are already living.&#8221; By 1960, some 
        builders and lenders were beginning to see a potential market in steadily 
        employed midddle class African Americans, but the African American middle 
        class remained a small proportion of all African Americans. Davis McEntire 
        argues that a middle-income African American with a modest down payment 
        and steady employment &#8220;is fully as good a credit risk as the white 
        person in comparable statistics,&#8221; but many lenders did not realize 
        this because they classified all African Americans together as a risk 
        on the basis of race. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and 
        Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and Housing </em>(Berkeley: 
        University of California Press, 1960), 238; 236.</p>
      <p>This simulation currently permits the participant to visit Deerfield 
        as the African American family, but it was unlikely that a broker would 
        be willing to show this African American family a house in Deerfield because 
        they would clearly not be able to afford a house in Deerfield on their 
        income. For a truly immersive and more accurate representation of the 
        past, the participant should be restricted from visiting Deerfield as 
        the African American family. Future revisions should consider a way to 
        manage this. For example, the &quot;broker&quot; might refuse to show 
        the family a house in Deerfield, but the family might be able to discover 
        the details of the controversy by reading several of the newspaper articles 
        used as primary sources for the Deerfield portion of the simulation.</p>

        I do not intend to &quot;bring the past to life.&quot; Rather, I have 
        constructed a multimedia argument that has interactive capabilities. Like 
        any other historical interpretation, I have taken evidence out of its 
        original context and arranged it in a way that supports my argument that 
        consumer agency is both enabled and restricted by a capitalist system 
        that is couched in the language of democracy but is far from democratic. 
      </p>
      <p>I have used images and audio to immerse the user in the role of buying 
        a home in Chicago in 1960 from the perspective of either a white family 
        or an African American family. The use of these images and audio, however, 
        is an act of interpretation. The use of images by historians to create 
        and sustain an argument has been limited. Images are typically used as 
        illustrations of points made in the text. The images in this simulation 
        argue as well as illustrate. Juxtaposed with audio recordings and text, 
        they become an integral part of my argument, subject to historical criticism. 
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, it is important to note that the images juxtaposed with quotations 
        in the Deerfield part of the simulation are authentic but not accurate. 
        Authentic means taken from primary sources of the time, such as magazines 
        and newspapers. For example, the picture of &quot;Morris Courington&quot; 
        was taken from a 1959 deoderant advertisement and used to represent the 
        real Morris Courington. An accurate image would be a picture of the real 
        Morris Courington. The picture of Morris Milgram is accurate because it 
        is a picture of Morris Milgram himself. Furthermore, the audio recordings 
        were made by graduate students, not professional voice actors. The graduate 
        students had access to the primary source documents from which the quotes 
        came. However, these documents include only minimal information about 
        the speakers, notably gender and sometimes occupation. Professional voice 
        actors are aware of additional issues that affect vocal interpretations, 
        such as age, ethnicity, and accent. As historians, we interpret spoken 
        words in text to support an argument. What effect does interpreting spoken 
        words in audio format have on an argument? The interpretations given in 
        this simulation are something of a historiographical experiment. Future 
        historians who use vocal interpretations in multimedia histories will 
        be confronted by these issues and will deal with them more effectively 
        than I have here.</p>
