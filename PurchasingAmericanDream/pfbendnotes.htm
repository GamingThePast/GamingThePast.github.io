      <p><a name="cautious"></a> <strong>cautious </strong>Lenders probably considered 
        lending to an African American in Park Forest less of a risk than in Deerfield, 
        but were likely to remain cautious. </p>
      <p>Lenders were often not able to cite a specific policy towards African 
        Americans. A Cleveland banker quoted in <em>The Cleveland Press</em>, 
        September 8, 1956, said: &quot;We do not insist that neighborhoods be 
        50 percent colored, or insist on any arbitrary statistical line before 
        lending to Negro applicants. Depends on circumstances.&quot; Lenders were 
        more likely to lend in areas that were clearly transitioning from white 
        to nonwhite occupancy. One African American family did not indicate that 
        Park Forest was in transition. After gauging the response of the community 
        to the first Negro resident, some lenders might decide to lend to others 
        if it seemed profitable to do so. Despite the apparently benign reaction 
        to the Wilsons, lenders would probably continue to be hesitant about lending 
        to other African Americans--especially lower-income families such as the 
        one in this simulation--in Park Forest until they had a better sense of 
        the community's long-term response to the family. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence

        Housing</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960), 225-226.</p>
      <p>Within eight years, however, many African Americans were able to find 
        homes in Park Forest. Of 411 black families able to find homes in the

      <p><a name="leastexpensive"></a> <strong>least expensive </strong>Philip 
        Klutznick, one of the developers of Park Forest, wanted to offer a variety 
        of houses in a range of prices in order to appeal to the largest market 
        possible, including the market that made too much money to qualify for 
        public housing but not enough money to afford the houses being produced 
        in the private market. Klutznick admitted to borrowing his design for 
        the Eastgate subdivision from Levitt's standard Cape Cod design for Levittowns. 
        Like Levitt's houses, the 750 square foot Cape Cods were originally built 
        with two bedrooms on the ground floor and an unfinished second floor, 
        but owners typically remodeled the second floor to make two additional 
        rooms. Eastgate's 283 homes were the lowest-priced homes ever offered 
        in Park Forest. In 1953, they sold for between $11,000 and $11,500--25 
        percent lower than anything else in the village. While they sold quickly, 
        they continued to be the cheapest and least desirable houses in Park Forest.

        because there were enough differences in the housing for everyone to know 
        that they were the &#8220;lower class&#8221; of housing. However, Park 
        Foresters did not like to call the people who lived there &#8220;working 
        class,&quot; so they called them &quot;people who work with their hands&quot; 
        or &quot;blue collar.&quot; Even though the homes were well-designed and 
        kept, everyone&#8212;including those who lived in them&#8212;knew that 
        they were not quite a part of Park Forest as the others were. William

        postwar suburban developments pointed out the conformity of their outward 
        appearance. However, remodeling was one way consumers could bring individuality 
        to a mass produced home. In 1960, the <em>New York Times </em>published 
        an article titled &quot;Guide to Remodeling: It Can Provide the Shortest 
        Route to Ideal Quarters.&quot; The article suggested that &quot;for many 
        families today, a 'new' home is an old one that they have remodeled...Whatever 
        the remodeling project, families who undertake it seem to fall into two 
        categories: those who need more space than they can afford in a new home, 
        and those who are tired of the stereotyped floor plans prevalent in buildings 
        constructed today.&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, &quot;Guide to Remodeling: 
        It Can Provide the Shortest Route to Ideal Quarters,&quot; March 30, 1960, 
        SMA4.</p>
      <p>Levittown was the quintessential postwar suburban development. In <em>Expanding 
        the American Dream: Building and Rebuilding Levittown</em> (Albany: State 
        University of New York Press, 1993), Barbara M. Kelley argues that Levittowners 
        actively reshaped the interiors of their homes, initially through do-it-yourself 
        projects and later through the growing industry of professional remodeling. 
      </p>
      <p>Kelly chides critics for their static view of postwar housing and advocates 
        a dynamic view instead. Standardization was necessary to meet the enormous 
        demand for housing after World War II. However, once the basic structures 
        were built, owners modified and customized their living space to suit 
        their own personal needs. The original design of the houses reinforced 
        a value system that was desirable and acceptable to the target market 
        of the builders&#8212;lower middle class and upper working class families. 
        Kelley argues that these families were included but not coerced into the 
        middle class by well-intentioned builders.</p>
      <p>However, families often found that the idealized upper-middle class design 
        did not suit the reality of their lower-middle class lives. Tension existed 
        between lower-income residents who wanted to expand the kitchen and other 
        working areas, and the developers, who sought to provide scaled-down versions 
        of a thoroughly middle class house where leisure areas such as living 
        rooms were larger. Producers designed the kitchen to accomodate the middle-class 
        value of a &#8220;nonworking&#8221; wife. However, the 1956 Women&#8217;s 
        Congress on Housing determined that the domestic workspace was too small. 
        Homeowners responded to this problem with the concept of the squared kitchen, 
        which provided women with more work space. Kelley argues that the status 
        of the home may have declined, but consumers exerted agency in their inclusion 
        into the middle class. They negotiated the extent to which they adapted 
        middle class values in the arrangement of their physical space.</p>
      <p>At first, remodeling projects were largely a do-it-yourself affair, but 
        a professionalized and standardized remodeling industry quickly sprang 
        up to meet the demand for customized housing. Families sought to make 
        the most of their living space as they went through the various stages 
        of the life cycle. The professional remodeling industry reclaimed some 
        of consumers' agency in that it only offered so many options as were profitable. 
        However, there were enough choices available that consumers could still 
        have something relatively individualized if they were unable or unwilling 
        to do an entire remodeling project by themselves. Like the remodeling 
        industry, developers were driven by the profit motive to respond to consumers&#8217; 
        wishes. Levitt altered floor plans as well as exterior details to provide 
        consumers with some choice, although exteriors were generally kept the 
        same to maintain an outward appearance of conformity and aesthetic cohesion. 
      </p>
      <p>Kelly concludes that &#8220;although the deliverers had neglected to 
        consult the homeowners prior to construction, the homeowners, far from 
        being passive, were more than willing to answer their own needs&#8221; 
        (100). A realistic representation of the suburban experience must take 
        into account the dynamic changes that occur over time, rather than the 
        typically static image of the suburbs as they were in the immediate postwar 
        period. </p>

      <p>In 1954, Park Forest was named an All-American City by the National Municipal 
        League for its efforts to build Rich Township High School. The high school's 
        physical structure was a $1,600,000 &quot;learning laboratory.&quot; Its 
        curriculum was based on the &quot;life adjustment&quot; concept that stressed 
        vocational skills as well as academic subjects. Parents occasionally complained 
        about the curriculum, demanding that more traditional academic subjects 
        be offered. However, when asked what they wanted students to learn from 
        their high school experience, most parents replied that they wanted their 
        children to learn how to get along with other people. </p>
      <p>Some parents felt that teachers at the six elementary schools were too 
        &#8220;permissive&#8221; because they allowed children's curiosity to 
        determine some of what they learned. Parents also questioned the flexibility 
        of grading. Instead of assigning traditional letter grades and percentages, 
        teachers used a checklist of criteria to rate student performance. William

      <p>According to <em>Time</em>, &quot;as soon as it became known that Charles 
        Wilson intended to move in, he was met by a seven-man Commission on Human 
        Relations and questioned about his job, the size of his family, whether 
        or not he was a member of any active pressure groups (he was not). Then 
        two-man teams moved through a two-block radius of Wilson's new house to 
        acquaint each household with the facts about the new neighbors. In a few 
        cases, the family clergyman had to be called in to soothe unduly ruffled 
        householders. Press, radio and TV were told about the move, asked to say 
        nothing about it to avoid attracting crackpots. They agreed.&quot; <em>Time</em>, 
        &quot;Planned Brotherhood,&quot; January 18, 1960, 18. </p>
      <p><em>Time</em> also notes the contrast between Park Forest and Deerfield's 
        approach to integration, highlighted by a quote by Village President Robert 
        Dinerstein: &quot;The principal reason we've been successful is that the 
        people of Park Forest are intelligent, responsible Americans who realize 
        a person's rights under law. They may not be happy about a Negro living 
        in Park Forest, but given the facts, they respect his rights under the 
        law.&quot; <em>Time</em>, &quot;Planned Brotherhood,&quot; January 18, 
        1960, 18. </p>
      <p>Despite the celebratory tone of the <em>Time</em> piece, the motives 
        of Park Foresters were probably not entirely altruistic towards African 
        Americans. Given the national coverage of the incident in Deerfield, the 
        leaders of Park Forest were likely as motivated by a fear of bad press 
        as they were a true belief in integration, particularly in 1960 as fair 
        housing was becoming politicized as a civil rights issue. </p>
      <p>The Commission on Human Relations was apparently formed specifically 
        to manage integration. Whites did not have to answer the Commission's 
        questions, although the first (white) tenants to move into the village 
        in 1948 had to apply and were screened according to income level, education, 
        veteran status, and need. It appears that the Commission did not have 
        any legal force to prevent African American families from moving in, but 
        African Americans who complied with the interview were probably more welcomed 
        than those who didn't. This simulation takes the view that while African 
        Americans theoretically had the option of refusing to answer the questions, 
        for practical purposes they did not. Additional research conducted on 
        families who refused to answer the questions could alter the design of 
        the simulation. Park Forest's response to the growing issue of fair housing 
        as a civil right, while perhaps not the response we would expect today, 
        seemed at the time to be fairly progressive. </p>
      <p>African American perception of the Commission on Human Relations certainly 
        varied individually, but the Wilsons (the first African American family 
        to move into Park Forest) and the Robinsons (another African American 
        family that moved into Park Forest in 1963) apparently accepted the practice 
        of the Commission. Yvonne and Leonard Robinson, who moved into Park Forest 
        in 1963, appreciated the community involvement because in 1962 protestors 
        had burned down Yvonne's brother&#8217;s house in another suburb. National 
        Museum of American History, <em>America on the Move</em>, http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/exhibition/exhibition_15_2.html</p>
      <p>Whether the Wilsons appreciated the idea of a Commission on Human Relations 
        or whether they simply tolerated it in order to move into the home they 
        wanted to is unknown. Nevertheless, of 411 black families able to find 
        homes in the suburbs of Chicago from 1959-1968, 180 of these were in Park

        American family in this simulation makes almost $2,000 less than this

      <p>Although the low interest rates associated with VA and FHA loans benefited 
        borrowers, the higher interest rates on conventional mortgages benefited 
        lenders, making them more attractive to them. Saul B. Klaman explains, 
        &#8220;in the face of generally rising interest rates and yields, federally 
        underwritten mortgages with less flexible rates became unattractive to 
        investors with alternative uses of funds.&#8221; Federally underwritten 
        mortgages suffered a competitive interest rate disadvantage compared to 
        conventional mortgages. The FHA was legally able to increase the permitted 
        maximum interest rate on FHA loans to make them more competitive with 
        conventional loans (as it did for example in December of 1956 when it 
        increased the interest rate from 4 &frac12; to 5 per cent. However, the 
        VA had no authority to increase the interest rate on VA loans, which was 
        at 4 &frac12; percent as 1956 ended. Federally-underwritten mortgages, 
        although advantageous to borrowers, could be difficult to obtain depending 
        on the status of the market at any given time. See Saul B. Klaman, <em>The 
        Postwar Residential Mortgage Market: A Study by the National Bureau of 
        Economic Research </em>(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961), 
        63 and 73.</p>
      <p> The median family income of nonwhite families with conventional mortgages 
        in 1956 was $3,835. $3,835 in 1960 dollars is $4,172.48. The African American 
        family in this simulation makes close to this amount if the wife's income 
        is included, but it is not (see <strong>working</strong> below). Although 
        houses in Park Forest cost less than houses in Deerfield, a family would 
        still probably have to make more than the median to be approved for a 
        loan. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive 
        Report to the Commission on Race and Housing </em>(Berkeley: University 
        of California Press, 1960), 220; NASA, <em>Consumer Price Index Inflation 
        Calculator</em>, http://www1.jsc.nasa.gov/bu2/inflateCPI.html </p>
      <p>The median family income of nonwhite families with no mortgages in 1956 
        was $2,238. $2,238 in 1960 dollars is $2,435. Families without mortgages 
        could usually only afford the least expensive housing available, which 
        was typically overcrowded and often in slum areas. Davis McEntire, <em>Residence 
        and Race: Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and

      <p>The African American family in this simulation has an income between 
        the median for a conventional mortgage and no mortgage. It is feasible 
        to suggest that this family might be approved for a conventional mortgage 
        at a higher interest rate than a government-underwritten mortgage in an 
        area where many African Americans already lived and where relatively inexpensive 
        housing could be found.</p>

      required by the FHA on a house appraised at $18,000 in 1958 was $1,400, 
      so the average house in Park Forest would require a down payment of $1,400 
      for an FHA loan. In 1956 Congress reduced the minimum down payment requirements 
      on existing homes bought with FHA loans to match those for new homes in 
      order to stimulate building by facilitating the sale of old houses by owners 
      seeking new ones, so presumably the down payment on an existing home would 
      be the same as a new home for the 1958 data in this table. The down payment 
      for a conventional mortgage would likely be even higher than that expected 
      by the FHA. This down payment amounts to about a third of a year's income 
      for the African American family in this simulation--an amount they would 
      be unlikely to have saved at this point in their life cycle. Leo Grebler,

      &quot;Sound business practice excluded or severely limited women in the 
      mortgage market because their incomes were thought to be unstable...the 
      spectre of pregnancy dominated the lending world's view...To lenders, all 
      women under the age of fifty were candidates for marriage and motherhood. 
      It was considered self-evident that as soon as a woman married, or shortly 
      thereafter, she would drop out of the work force and thereby render herself 
      incapable of sustaining a mortgage payment.&quot; <p>The 1968 Fair Housing 
        Act prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing 
        on account of race, color, religion, and national origin, but discrimination 
        on the basis of sex was not prohibited. Not until the passage of the Equal 
        Credit Opportunity Act in 1973 prohibited discrimination on account of 
        sex or marital status, and a 1974 companion bill prohibited discrimination 
        on account of sex under the Fair Housing Act, were women's incomes regularly 
        considered in lending decisions (before the laws were passed, women's 
        incomes were considered in limited cases where her husband could not qualify 
        on the basis of his income alone and where the woman was in the later 
        part of her childbearing years or had already had two or more children).

        but not all, of a wife's income. Some lenders required a &quot;baby letter&quot; 
        attesting to the husband or wife's sterility, use of approved birth control 
        methods, or willingness to terminate a pregnancy in order to count the

        include both white and nonwhite females; however, in <em>Residence and 
        Race: Final and Comprehensive Report to the Commission on Race and Housing</em> 
        (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960), Davis McEntire suggests 
        that the gap between the incomes of white and nonwhite females is significantly 
        smaller than the gap between the incomes of white and nonwhite males, 
        perhaps because nonwhite women tend to complete more education and are 
        able to obtain better-paying jobs as a result, because nonwhite women 
        are perceived as less of a threat than nonwhite men, or because sex is 
        the primary form of discrimination faced by all women regardless of race.

      <a name="stable"></a> <strong>stable</strong> The positive initial response 
      to the Wilsons suggested that residents were not likely to begin panic selling, 
      causing property values to decline. However, this simulation takes place 
      only a short time after the Wilsons moved in (December 1959). It would not 
      be immediately apparent if property values were going to hold steady or 
      decline at that time. Mr. Wilson was an assistant professor of economics 
      at De Paul University--a substantially middle class profession. Even though 
      the family in this simulation could probably afford one of the $12,000 to 
      $13,000 houses in the Eastgate subdivision, the Eastgate area was implicitly 
      known as the &quot;working class&quot; part of Park Forest. Lending to an 
      African American in that area might provoke a fear of creating a &quot;suburban 
      ghetto,&quot; which would be much more likely to cause property values to 
      decline. 
      <p>Lenders were often not able to cite a specific policy towards African 
        Americans. A Cleveland banker quoted in <em>The Cleveland Press</em>, 
        September 8, 1956, said: &quot;We do not insist that neighborhoods be 
        50 percent colored, or insist on any arbitrary statistical line before 
        lending to Negro applicants. Depends on circumstances.&quot; Lenders were 
        more likely to lend in areas that were clearly transitioning from white 
        to nonwhite occupancy. One African American family did not indicate that 
        Park Forest was in transition. After gauging the response of the community 
        to the first African American resident, some lenders might decide to lend 
        to others if it seemed profitable to do so. Despite the apparently benign 
        reaction to the Wilsons, lenders would probably continue to be hesitant 
        about lending to other African Americans in Park Forest until they had 
        a better sense of the community's long-term response to the family. Davis 
        McEntire, <em>Residence and Race: Final and Comprehensive Report to the 
        Commission on Race and Housing</em> (Berkeley: University of California 
        Press, 1960), 225-226.</p>
      <p>Within eight years, however, many African Americans were able to find 
        homes in Park Forest. Of 411 black families able to find homes in the 
        suburbs of Chicago from 1959-1968, 180 of these were in Park Forest. Brian
