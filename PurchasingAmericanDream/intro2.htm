    <td > <p>This simulation is a representation of buying a home in
        Chicago in 1960. As you interact with the simulation, it is important
        to remember that this is an <a href="introendnotes.htm#interpretation">interpretation</a>
        of historical evidence. </p>
      <p>The simulation allows you to take on the role of a white family or an
        African American family. You should take on both roles to get the full
        experience, but the order does not matter. </p>
      <p>Within the simulation, &quot;Negro&quot; is used in place of &quot;African 
        American&quot; because it was the term commonly used in 1960. </p>
      <p>Throughout the simulation, you will see linked words. Pictures are also
        linked. Clicking on a linked word or picture will take you to an endnote.
        The endnote will be at the top of your screen. You'll see the word you
        clicked on in bold. These endnotes include the source of the information.
        Sometimes an endnote will include additional information related to the
        topic. To get back into the simulation, click on the &quot;Back&quot;
        link that follows each endnote.</p>
      <p>To move through the simulation, click on the <strong><font size="+2"><a href="intro2.htm">&raquo;</a>
        </font></strong>located in the bottom right-hand corner. Sometimes the
        <strong><font size="+2"><a href="intro2.htm">&raquo;</a></font></strong>
        will follow a narrative transition that suggests what the content of the
        next page will be. Other times the <strong><font size="+2"><a href="intro2.htm">&raquo;</a></font></strong>
        will follow the options you are given in response to a question asked
        on that page. For example:</p>
      <p>What would you like to do?</p>
